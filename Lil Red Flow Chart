Little Red Riding Hood
Little Red has to decide whether to visit grandma
Does she go by meadow or forest?
  Option 1: she goes by meadow and she can choose to look around or just keeping skipping
    If she looks around, she'll spy the wolf and will roll the dice to see if she makes it home safely
      If she makes it home, she starts again deciding which way to go to grandma's
      If she rolls low, she dies and you exit the game
    If she keeps skipping she gets to grandma's house and the wolf eats her
    
  Option 2: she goes by the forest path, sees the woodsman and either talks or doesn't talk to him
    If she doesn't talk to him she gets to grandma's house and the wolf eats her
    If she talks to him:
      a. He becomes a friend
      b. she goes to grandma's house
      c. the woodsman hears her scream when she discovers that the wolf has eaten grandma and saves the day
